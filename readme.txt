This folder contains the files needed to create a Haju smell device

You will need a set of components

An Arduino UNO
2 x microservos (one continuous type and another linear type)
1 push to close switch
A 220kOhm resistor
an NPN transistor
A USB desk humidifier (e.g. A Douself Mini Portable Magic Wand Stick (http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00OUSHI2G) But any similar 5V humidifier can be made to work (with more or less effort)
microUSB cable (probably can be used from the humidifier)
5V battery to run the humidifier

A circuit diagram is is provided to illustrate how the electronic components should be combined. An Arduino sketch is provided to act as control software. This receives commands via the Arduino serial monitor to control scents from the device.


The case and most of the supports to hold the smell container, ratchet for the humidifier etc. are CNC'd, and are provided in adobe illustrator format.

The ratchet and smell container are 3D printed and provided in Rhino compatible files.

Full details on building the case are forthcoming, but the enclosed images should help to illustrate how the device goes together.
