This folder contains the 3D printing files for the Olfactory container, and the ratchet to hold and support movement of the Humidifer device.

You may need to adjust the ratchet aperture to accomodate a different humidifier 

The container can be completed by cutting drinking straws to 5cm, and filling with cigarette filter material. We have found this to be a good fibre to draw fluid up towards the humidifier.

smell_bottle.3dm is the Rhino model for the smell bottle and the ratchet for moving the humidifier components. The folder Smell Bottle contains stl files sutable for each component part to be printed.
